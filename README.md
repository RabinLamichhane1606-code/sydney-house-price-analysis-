HousePriceAnalysis


This project analyzes Sydney property sales data to uncover trends and build a simple predictive model.

## Project Overview

We explore house price trends across Sydney suburbs using a dataset of property sales over recent years. The project includes:

- Data cleaning and filtering for Sydney suburbs
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Building a linear regression model to predict house prices based on features like bedrooms and bathrooms

## Dataset

The dataset used is the NSW Property Sales data, containing property sale records with features such as suburb, sale price, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, land size, and sale date.

## Technologies

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run

1. Download the repository.
2. Ensure the CSV file (`NSW_property_sales.csv`) is in the same folder as the notebook.
3. Open `Sydney_House_Price_Analysis.ipynb` with Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
4. Run the cells sequentially to see the analysis and model results.
